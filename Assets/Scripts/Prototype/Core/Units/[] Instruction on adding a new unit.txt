How to create a new unit:

1. Add a model into the screen and make it a prefab (prefab location: Assets/Prefabs/Prototype/Units/).
NOTE: The name of the prefab must be the exact same as the name of the new unit.

2. Create a script (script location: Assets/Scripts/Prototype/Core/Units/) with the name of the unit.
NOTE: The name of the script must be the exact same as the name of the new unit.

3. Make the script inherit Unit instead of Monobehavior and implement the necessary methods (generating move set / attack set).

4. Open Assets/Scripts/Prototype/Core/Enum/UnitType.cs and add the name of the new unit into the enum list.
NOTE: The name added must be the exact same as the name of the new unit.

5. Go to the prefab that was saved in step 1 and add 2 new scripts:
- FIRST, add a tweener. A tweener determine how a unit moves.
(if the unit does not move, just put instant tweener as a placeholder)
- SECOND, add the script of the unit.

6. Open Assets/Data/Test Layout - 01.asset and add the unit starting spawn point as we don't have a spawning system yet.

7. On the PrototypeX scene, Controllers > Unit Creator. Add your unit prefab to the prefab list (you will see the other units there).

8. Pray that your unit spawned on the screen.

9. If you are successful in step 8, congratulation. Now, you can go to your prefab and edit:
- The size of the unit (because it's highly unlikely that you get the ideal size on your first try. I blame local scaling)
- The stats of the unit
